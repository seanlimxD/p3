## 1. Interface
Address as many of the following points as applicable:

+ What are your initial impressions of the site interface?
Simple and easy to understand.
+ Were there any parts of the interface that you found confusing, or did not work as you expected?
The header for the radio-box selection wasn't spaced very well, floating above the actual section. There is also no way to return to the form after submission besides the native back function on the user's browser.
+ Were there any parts of the interface that you thought worked notably well?
The interface was overall very easy to understand.
+ Do you have any suggestions for improvements on the interface?
For consistency's sake, change the font in the labels for the meal selection to Courier, like the options in the drink dropdown are. At the same time, try to space the headers for each section more consistently to avoid confusion.


## 2. Functional testing
+ Submitted form without any data: test produced the expected result.
+ Submitted form with only one field filled: all three tests produced the expected result.
+ Submitted form with two fields filled: all three tests produced the expected result.
+ Tried submitting an overly long, realistically impossible name: server threw an error. Seems like the name field has no requirements beyond being filled.


## 3. Code: Routes
There is no code here that should be placed in a controller. Well done!

## 4. Code: Views
+ Is template inheritance used?
Yes, for the two views used in the application.
+ Are there any separation of concern issues (i.e. non-display specific logic in view files)?
There is no code here that doesn't belong in a view.
+ Did they do anything in PHP that could have been done in Blade?
No, Blade was used to its fullest potential.
+ Did they use any Blade syntax/techniques you were unfamiliar with?
No. I understood all the Blade code used in the views.s

## 5. Code: General
+ Do you notice any inconsistencies between the code and the course notes on [code style](https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-fall2018/blob/master/misc/code-style.md)?
I did not.
+ Are there any best practices discussed in course material that you feel were not addressed in the code?
No.
+ Are there aspects of the code that you feel were not self-evident and would benefit from comments?
No! The code was clear and easy to understand.
+ Are there any parts of the code that you found interesting/would not have thought to do yourself?
Not really. The code was overall very similar to mine.
+ Are there any parts of the code that you don't understand?
No.

## 6. Misc
Do you have any additional comments not covered in the above questions?
No.
